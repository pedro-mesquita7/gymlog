# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 27

## Overview

Build a local-first PWA for strength training tracking with proper data engineering. Start by establishing the foundation (data layer, core entities), enable workout creation and logging, add analytics and history tracking, then ensure data durability with export/backup capabilities. Every phase delivers verifiable user value while showcasing modern data engineering practices.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Layer

**Goal**: Users can manage exercises and gyms with all data properly stored in event-sourced Parquet files

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements**: EXER-01, EXER-02, EXER-03, EXER-04, GYM-01, GYM-02, GYM-03, GYM-04, DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-07, DATA-08, DATA-09

**Success Criteria**:
1. User can create, edit, delete, and view exercises with name, muscle group, and global/gym-specific flag
2. User can create, edit, delete, and view gyms with name and optional location
3. All data is stored in DuckDB-WASM using Parquet files in OPFS
4. All changes are captured as immutable events with audit columns (_created_at, _event_id)
5. dbt models transform raw events to staging to marts

**Plans**: 8 plans

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, dependencies
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — DuckDB initialization and event sourcing infrastructure
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — dbt models (staging, intermediate, marts)
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Exercise management (CRUD + filtering)
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Gym management (CRUD + exercise association)
- [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — Human verification of Phase 1
- [x] 01-07-PLAN.md — Gap closure: Enable OPFS persistence
- [x] 01-08-PLAN.md — Gap closure: UI polish

### Phase 2: Templates & Logging

**Goal**: Users can create workout templates and log workouts with full exercise substitution support

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Requirements**: TMPL-01, TMPL-02, TMPL-03, TMPL-04, TMPL-05, TMPL-06, TMPL-07, LOG-01, LOG-02, LOG-03, LOG-04, LOG-05, LOG-06, LOG-07, LOG-08, LOG-09

**Success Criteria**:
1. User can create workout templates with ordered exercises, target rep ranges, and optional replacements
2. User can edit templates (add/remove/reorder exercises) and delete templates
3. User can start workout by selecting gym and template, seeing exercises in order with target rep ranges
4. User can log each set with weight (kg) and reps, optionally adding RIR
5. User can switch from default exercise to predefined replacement or add custom one-off exercise
6. User can use rest timer between sets with configurable duration
7. User can complete workout (saving all data) or cancel workout in progress with confirmation

**Plans**: 9 plans

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Install dependencies and create types/events
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — useTemplates hook with CRUD operations
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — TemplateBuilder form with drag-drop
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Template List UI with navigation tabs
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Zustand workout store and StartWorkout
- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — Active workout UI (ExerciseView, SetLogger)
- [x] 02-07-PLAN.md — Rest timer and exercise substitution
- [x] 02-08-PLAN.md — Workout completion and cancellation
- [x] 02-09-PLAN.md — Human verification of Phase 2

### Phase 3: History & Analytics

**Goal**: Users can view exercise history, track PRs, see estimated 1RM, and benefit from data quality validation

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Requirements**: HIST-01, HIST-02, HIST-03, HIST-04, HIST-05, DATA-05, DATA-06, DATA-10, DATA-11

**Success Criteria**:
1. User can view exercise history showing last 2 weeks of sets, respecting global vs gym-specific rule
2. User sees automatic PR detection when new PR is set during logging
3. User can view estimated 1RM for exercises (Epley formula) and list of all PRs per exercise
4. dbt tests validate data quality
5. dbt documentation generates data dictionary and lineage graphs
6. Metrics layer defines 1RM, volume, and PR calculations
7. Anomaly detection flags unusual values

**Plans**: 7 plans

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — dbt staging models and analytics macros
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — dbt intermediate models (1RM, PR, anomaly)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — dbt mart models, tests, documentation
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Compiled SQL queries for runtime
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — useHistory hook and ExerciseHistory component
- [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — PR detection and 1RM display components
- [x] 03-07-PLAN.md — Human verification of Phase 3

### Phase 4: Data Durability

**Goal**: Users can export/import their workout data and receive backup reminders

**Depends on**: Phase 3

**Requirements**: DURA-01, DURA-02, DURA-03

**Success Criteria**:
1. User can export all data as Parquet file download
2. User can import data from Parquet backup file
3. App shows backup reminder after N workouts since last export

**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Backup store and export hook
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Import hook with validation
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Backup UI and App integration

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- DEV-001 to DEV-066: See STATE.md for full decision log
- DuckDB-WASM + Parquet for modern DE showcase
- Event sourcing for immutable audit trail
- dbt-duckdb at build time for docs/tests without runtime complexity
- Zustand with persist for client-side state

**Issues Resolved:**
- DuckDB-WASM parameterized queries not supported (used string interpolation)
- OPFS file locking bugs in dev versions (pinned to stable 1.32.0)
- Infinite render loops with store selectors (used useMemo)

**Technical Debt:**
- PRList component built but not surfaced in UI
- Demo mode backup reminders not shown (by design)
