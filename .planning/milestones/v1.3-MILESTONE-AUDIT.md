## Build Verification

- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes (zero errors)
- Unit tests: 71/71 pass (7 test files)
- E2E tests: 13 tests across 5 spec files (CI-validated)
- Build: 1751 modules transformed, dist/ generated
- Bundle: main 576KB/660KB, analytics 522KB/600KB, duckdb 187KB/215KB, total 1286KB/1480KB
- Service worker: 38 precache entries (1834.79 KB), dist/sw.js 27KB

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All phases passed verification with zero blocking or non-blocking gaps.

## Known Issues (Pre-existing, Not v1.3 Debt)

- Backup reminders only work in persistent mode (by design)
- dbt vw_progression_status.sql references fw.logged_at but fact_workouts uses started_at (non-blocking — compiled queries bypass dbt at runtime)
