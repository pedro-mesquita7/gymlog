### Data Engineering (11/11)
- [x] DATA-01: Star schema (fact_sets, dim_exercise, dim_gym, dim_workout_template)
- [x] DATA-02: DuckDB-WASM with Parquet in OPFS

- [x] DATA-08: Idempotent event processing
- [x] DATA-09: Parquet files partitioned by month
- [x] DATA-10: Metrics layer (1RM, volume, PR calculations)
- [x] DATA-11: Anomaly detection (50%+ weight jump)

### Data Durability (3/3)
- [x] DURA-01: Export all data as Parquet
- [x] DURA-02: Import data from Parquet backup
- [x] DURA-03: Backup reminder after N workouts

## Integration Check Results

**Status:** PASSED

### Connected Flows (8/8)
1. Exercise CRUD → Event sourcing → Query
2. Gym CRUD → Event sourcing → Query
3. Template CRUD → Event sourcing → Query
4. Workout completion → Event writing → Backup counter
5. History viewing with gym context filtering
6. PR detection during set logging
7. Backup export from events table
8. Backup import with duplicate skip

### Cross-Phase Wiring
- Phase 1 provides `writeEvent()`, `getDuckDB()`, compiled SQL
- Phase 2 uses Phase 1 event writing, reads exercises
- Phase 3 uses Phase 1 queries, integrates into Phase 2 workout UI
- Phase 4 uses Phase 1 database access, integrates with Phase 2 completion

### Minor Finding
- `PRList` component is built but not surfaced in UI (orphaned)
- Impact: Low (enhancement opportunity, not a broken feature)

## Technical Debt

| Item | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| PRList not integrated | Low | Component exists but not visible in UI |
| Demo mode limitations | Info | Backup reminders only work in persistent mode (by design) |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total plans executed | 27 |
| Average execution time | 2.6 min |
| Total execution time | ~70 min |

## Verification Methods Used

1. **Formal Verification** (Phases 1, 2): gsd-verifier agent with VERIFICATION.md
2. **Human Verification** (Phases 3, 4): Manual testing during execution checkpoints
3. **Integration Testing**: gsd-integration-checker for cross-phase wiring

## Conclusion

GymLog v1.0 delivers a complete, functional workout tracking application that:
- Tracks exercises, gyms, templates, and workout sessions
- Provides exercise history with gym context filtering
- Detects and displays personal records during logging
- Shows estimated 1RM using Epley formula
- Exports/imports data via Parquet for backup
- Showcases proper data engineering (event sourcing, dbt models, star schema)

All 38 v1 requirements are satisfied. The milestone is ready for release.
