# v1.2 Milestone Audit: UX & Portfolio Polish

## Summary

**Status:** PASSED
**Requirements:** 28/28 satisfied
**Phases:** 4/4 complete (8, 9, 10, 11)
**Integration:** 15/15 critical wiring points connected
**E2E Flows:** 4/4 user journeys verified

## Requirements Coverage

All 28 v1.2 requirements marked Complete:

| Category | Requirements | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Batch Logging | BLOG-01 to BLOG-05 | 5/5 Complete |
| Workout Rotation | ROTN-01 to ROTN-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| Workout Summary | SUMM-01 to SUMM-03 | 3/3 Complete |
| Visual Polish | UI-01 to UI-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| Testing & Quality | TEST-01 to TEST-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| CI/CD | CICD-01 to CICD-03 | 3/3 Complete |
| Portfolio & Demo | PORT-01 to PORT-05 | 5/5 Complete |

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Status | UAT |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|
| 8. Testing & Design Foundation | 7/7 | Complete | N/A (foundation) |
| 9. Batch Logging & Visual Polish | 5/5 | Complete | Verified |
| 10. Workout Features & Demo Data | 4/4 | Complete | 14/14 passed |
| 11. CI/CD & Portfolio | 7/7 | Complete | 12/12 passed + 3/3 retest |

## Cross-Phase Integration

15 critical wiring points verified with file paths and line numbers:
- Phase 8 UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, Dialog) used in 9+ Phase 9-11 components
- Phase 9 batch logging (SetGrid, useLastSessionData) integrated into workout flow
- Phase 10 rotation store connected to QuickStart, StartWorkout, WorkoutComplete
- Phase 11 observability and data quality integrated into Settings page
- Phase 11 CI pipeline runs Phase 8 tests (Vitest + Playwright)
- compiled-queries.ts consumed by 7 hooks across Phases 5-11

**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Workout logging | Start → SetGrid → Complete → Summary with PRs | Functional |
| Rotation cycle | Configure → QuickStart → Advance after completion | Functional |
| Demo + analytics | Load data → Analytics → Data quality → Observability | Functional |
| Settings hub | Rotation + Demo + Observability + Data Quality accessible | Functional |

## Tech Debt (Non-Critical)

4 minor items across 3 phases — none are blockers:
1. Phase 8/9 VERIFICATIONs showed initial gaps, all resolved via gap closure
2. coi-serviceworker cosmetic Vite warning (functional, just noisy)
3. GitHub Pages requires manual repo Settings configuration (one-time)

## Build Health

- Build time: ~13s
- Main bundle: 552KB (gzipped: 167KB)
- Analytics bundle: 556KB lazy-loaded (gzipped: 182KB)
- DuckDB chunk: 192KB isolated
- Fonts: 26 woff/woff2 files bundled correctly
- 71+ unit tests passing
