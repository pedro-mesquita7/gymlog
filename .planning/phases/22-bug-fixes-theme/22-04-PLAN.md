<objective>
Replace all rounded-2xl (16px) usages with rounded-xl (12px) across the entire codebase for Apple-subtle border radius.

Purpose: CONTEXT.md specifies Apple-subtle 10-12px border radius. The token --radius-lg was updated to 0.75rem (12px) in Plan 01, but Tailwind's built-in `rounded-2xl` class (16px) bypasses the token system. This plan sweeps all 108 occurrences.
Output: Consistent 12px border radius throughout the app.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Replace all rounded-2xl with rounded-xl across the codebase</name>
  <files>(all files containing rounded-2xl — approximately 44 files, 108 occurrences)</files>
  <action>
Run a codebase-wide search-and-replace: `rounded-2xl` -> `rounded-xl` in all `.tsx`, `.ts`, and `.css` files under `src/`.

This is a safe mechanical replacement because:
- `rounded-2xl` = Tailwind's 1rem (16px) — the old radius
- `rounded-xl` = Tailwind's 0.75rem (12px) — the new Apple-subtle radius
- No component uses `rounded-2xl` for a reason distinct from "card/surface radius"

Use `sed` or equivalent to do a bulk find-and-replace across all files. Verify the count matches expectations (~108 occurrences across ~44 files).

After the bulk replace, also check for any `rounded-3xl` usages and replace with `rounded-2xl` (one step down) to maintain the relative scale.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `grep -rn "rounded-2xl" src/` — should return zero results. Run `grep -rn "rounded-xl" src/ | wc -l` — should be approximately 108 (the previous count of rounded-2xl). Run `npx vite build` — should succeed.</verify>
  <done>Zero instances of `rounded-2xl` remain in src/. All cards and surfaces use `rounded-xl` (12px). Build passes.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep -rn "rounded-2xl" src/` returns zero results
2. `npx vite build` succeeds
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- No `rounded-2xl` in the codebase
- All surfaces use rounded-xl (12px) consistent with Apple-subtle aesthetic
- Build passes
</success_criteria>
