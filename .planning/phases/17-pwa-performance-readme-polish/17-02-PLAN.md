<objective>
Overhaul README.md into a portfolio-grade document that leads with the data engineering narrative, prominently features the live demo link, includes screenshot/GIF placeholders, and provides verified run-locally instructions.

Purpose: The README is the first thing hiring managers and senior engineers see (README-01, README-02, README-03). It must tell the story of WHY this project demonstrates senior DE skills, not just what it does.

Output: A polished README.md that serves as a portfolio landing page.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README as portfolio showcase</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md with this structure. Preserve the existing Mermaid architecture and lineage diagrams -- they are good. Fix inaccuracies and improve presentation.

**Structure (top to bottom):**

1. **Title + tagline**: "GymLog" with one-line tagline about event-sourced workout tracking with DuckDB-WASM
2. **Badges row**: Live Demo (link to GitHub Pages -- keep placeholder URL pattern `username.github.io/gymlog` for now, user will update), CI/CD, TypeScript, DuckDB-WASM, React, Tailwind CSS
3. **Screenshot/GIF placeholder**: Add an HTML comment block with instructions:
   ```
   <!--
   TODO: Add hero screenshot or GIF here
   Recommended: GIF showing workout logging flow + analytics dashboard
   Size: 800px wide, optimize with gifski or similar
   Place file at: docs/demo.gif
   Usage: ![GymLog Demo](docs/demo.gif)
   -->
   ```
4. **Why This Project** (keep existing content -- it's strong): Data engineering narrative explaining DuckDB-WASM, event sourcing, dbt, dimensional modeling in browser
5. **Key Features** (new section): Bullet list of user-facing features grouped by category:
   - Workout Tracking: templates, drag-drop, batch logging, ghost text, rotation
   - Analytics: progress charts, volume zones (Schoenfeld research), muscle heat map, plateau detection
   - Data Engineering: event sourcing, DuckDB-WASM OLAP, dbt transformations, Parquet export
   - Portfolio: one-click demo data, TOON export for AI, OKLCH design system
6. **Architecture** (keep existing Mermaid diagram, clean up)
7. **Key Data Engineering Decisions** (keep existing 4 sections -- they're strong portfolio content)
8. **Data Model & Lineage** (keep existing Mermaid diagram)
9. **Tech Stack** (update table -- fix Vite version from "6.x" to "5.4", add vite-plugin-pwa, add framer-motion, add @toon-format/toon)
10. **Getting Started** (rewrite):
    - Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm
    - Three commands: `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`
    - Visit URL, click "Load Demo Data"
    - Note about DuckDB-WASM first-load download
    - Note about Chromium requirement (SharedArrayBuffer/OPFS)
11. **Running Tests** (keep, update test count if different)
12. **Project Structure** (update to match current structure -- check actual directories)
13. **CI/CD Pipeline** (keep, it's good)
14. **Performance** (new section): Brief note about lazy-loaded analytics, code splitting, DuckDB CDN caching. Reference PERFORMANCE.md (to be created in 17-03).
15. **License**: MIT

**Fixes to apply:**
- Vite version: "6.x" -> "5.4" (check package.json)
- Add missing tech to stack table: framer-motion, @toon-format/toon, react-muscle-highlighter, zod
- Update test count to match current state
- Ensure "Getting Started" instructions actually work from clean clone: `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`
- Remove any stale placeholder content
- Keep Mermaid diagrams intact -- they render on GitHub
  </action>
  <verify>
- `README.md` exists and is well-structured markdown
- Contains live demo badge with GitHub Pages URL pattern
- Contains "Getting Started" section with clone + install + dev commands
- Contains screenshot/GIF placeholder comment
- Mermaid diagrams preserved (search for ```mermaid blocks)
- Tech stack table has correct Vite version (5.4, not 6.x)
- No broken markdown syntax (check headings, links, code blocks)
  </verify>
  <done>README.md is a portfolio-grade document with live demo link, screenshot placeholder, working run-locally instructions, accurate tech stack, and preserved architecture diagrams</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. README.md renders correctly as markdown (no syntax errors)
2. Live demo badge URL present
3. "Getting Started" section has exactly: git clone, npm install, npm run dev
4. Mermaid architecture + lineage diagrams preserved
5. Tech stack table version numbers match package.json
6. Screenshot/GIF placeholder with instructions exists
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README leads with data engineering narrative and live demo link
- Screenshot/GIF placeholder exists with clear instructions for adding media
- Run-locally instructions are clone -> install -> dev (3 commands)
- All version numbers accurate
- Mermaid diagrams preserved and correct
</success_criteria>
