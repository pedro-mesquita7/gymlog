# Plan 08-07: Visual Verification & Cleanup

**Requirements:** UI-01, UI-02 (final verification of design work)
**Depends on:** 08-02, 08-03, 08-04 (all design work complete)

## Goal

Run the full test suite, verify coverage meets target, ensure the build succeeds, and do a final cleanup pass. Fix any TypeScript errors, remove console.log debugging statements from production hooks, and verify the app renders correctly with Geist fonts and design tokens.

## Tasks

1. **Run full test suite and check coverage**
   - Run `npm run test:coverage`
   - Verify coverage meets ~60-70% for tested hooks and stores
   - If any tests fail, fix them
   - Run `npm run test:e2e` to verify Playwright passes

2. **Clean up console.log statements in hooks**
   - Remove debug `console.log` statements from `src/hooks/useHistory.ts` (the `[useExerciseMax]` logs on lines 162-203)
   - Remove debug `console.log` from `src/components/workout/SetLogger.tsx` (line 41)
   - These were development debugging aids, not needed in production

3. **Verify build succeeds**
   - Run `npm run build` — must complete with zero errors
   - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — must compile cleanly

4. **Final review checklist**
   - Verify `src/styles/fonts.css` loads Geist fonts
   - Verify `src/index.css` has @theme design tokens
   - Verify error boundaries wrap all feature sections in App.tsx
   - Verify Button, Input, Card primitives export from `src/components/ui/`
   - Verify migrated components (StartWorkout, SetLogger, TemplateCard) use primitives
   - Count total tests and confirm 25+ exist

## Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes all tests
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e` passes
- [ ] No console.log debug statements in production hooks
- [ ] `npm run test:coverage` shows ~60-70% for hooks/stores

## Files
- `src/hooks/useHistory.ts` (modify - remove console.logs)
- `src/components/workout/SetLogger.tsx` (modify - remove console.log)
- Any test files that need fixing (conditional)
