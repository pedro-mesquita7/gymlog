<objective>
Rewrite README.md for portfolio reviewers targeting v1.5 feature set.

Purpose: README is the first thing a hiring manager or recruiter sees. It must showcase this as a senior Data Engineer portfolio piece with event sourcing + DuckDB as the technical differentiator. All references to removed features (comparison, progression dashboard, plateau detection) must be eliminated.
Output: Complete README.md rewrite reflecting current v1.5 state.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README for portfolio audience</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Rewrite README.md with this structure and content:

    1. **Hero section:**
       - Project name + one-line tagline emphasizing event sourcing + DuckDB-WASM
       - Badges: Live Demo, TypeScript, DuckDB-WASM, React, Tailwind CSS
       - GIF placeholder comment (for future animated demo capture)

    2. **Why This Project:**
       - Position as a senior Data Engineer portfolio piece
       - Emphasize: event sourcing, DuckDB-WASM OLAP, dbt transformations, Kimball dimensional modeling, OPFS persistence
       - Make clear this is NOT just a workout app -- it is a complete analytical data stack in the browser

    3. **Key Features** (updated for v1.5):
       - Workout Tracking: plans with drag-drop, batch set logging with ghost text, workout rotation + Quick Start, post-workout summary with PRs, exercise notes per session, auto-calculated warmup hints
       - Analytics: exercise progress charts (weight, 1RM, volume), volume per muscle group with research-backed zones, anatomical heat map
       - NO references to: comparison analytics, progression dashboard, plateau detection, regression detection
       - Data Engineering: event sourcing, DuckDB-WASM, dbt, Parquet export/import
       - Portfolio: one-click demo data, TOON export, OKLCH design system, CI/CD

    4. **Architecture diagram** (Mermaid -- GitHub renders natively):
       - Show: User Events -> Zustand -> DuckDB Event Store -> dbt layers (staging/intermediate/marts) -> Analytics views -> Recharts UI
       - Include OPFS persistence
       - Update style colors to match teal theme if appropriate

    5. **Key Data Engineering Decisions:**
       - Keep existing sections (Event Sourcing, DuckDB-WASM, dbt, OPFS) -- they are well-written
       - Remove any mentions of comparison or progression features

    6. **Data Model and Lineage** (Mermaid):
       - Keep existing diagram but remove vw_progression_status if it was removed in phase 23
       - Verify all referenced views still exist in the codebase before including

    7. **Tech Stack table:**
       - Update versions to match current package.json
       - Rename "Workout templates" to "Workout plans" in descriptions
       - Add warmup and notes as features if relevant

    8. **Getting Started:**
       - Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm
       - Clone, install, dev server commands
       - "Load Demo Data" instruction for instant portfolio review
       - Browser requirements note (Chromium for SharedArrayBuffer + OPFS)

    9. **Running Tests:**
       - Unit: `npm run test`
       - E2E: `npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:e2e`
       - dbt: `cd dbt && pip install -r requirements.txt && dbt compile --target browser`

    10. **Project Structure:**
        - Update directory descriptions to reflect current state
        - Mention notes and warmup components
        - Use "plans" not "templates" in descriptions

    11. **CI/CD Pipeline** section (keep existing)

    12. **Performance** section (keep existing, remove PERFORMANCE.md reference if file does not exist)

    13. **License:** MIT

    14. **Footer tagline** updated for v1.5

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT include a "Changelog" or "Removed Features" section -- only show current state.
    IMPORTANT: Use "Plans" not "Templates" when referring to workout plans (UI was renamed in phase 19).
    IMPORTANT: Check if `PERFORMANCE.md` exists before referencing it. If not, remove the link.
    IMPORTANT: Verify dbt views referenced in the lineage diagram still exist by checking `dbt/models/marts/` directory.

- README.md accurately reflects v1.5 features
- No references to comparison/progression/plateau/regression features
- Architecture and lineage diagrams are Mermaid and render correctly
- Getting Started section has actionable commands
- "Plans" used instead of "Templates" throughout
</verification>

<success_criteria>
README.md is a polished portfolio piece that a hiring manager can read in 5 minutes and understand: (1) this demonstrates senior Data Engineering skills, (2) the technical architecture is sophisticated, and (3) they can try a live demo immediately.
