<objective>
Verify the complete batch logging experience and visual polish across the app. This is a human verification checkpoint to catch visual issues, interaction problems, and inconsistencies that automated tests cannot detect.

Purpose: Batch logging is the highest-UX-impact feature in Phase 9. Visual polish must feel cohesive. Both require human eyes.
Output: Approval or issue list for gap closure

  <what-built>
Complete batch logging experience with card-based set grid, ghost text from last session, auto-save on blur, rest timer banner, completion/cancel dialogs, page transitions, and visual design consistency across all screens.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Batch Logging Flow:**
1. Start a workout (select gym + template)
2. Verify: Card-based grid shows for first exercise with correct number of rows (matching template set count)
3. Verify: If you've logged before, ghost text appears as placeholder in weight/reps/RIR fields
4. Tap a weight field -- verify all text selects for quick overwrite
5. Enter weight=60, reps=10, RIR=2, then tap outside the row
6. Verify: Set auto-saves (navigate away and back -- data persists)
7. Verify: Rest timer banner appears at top after completing a set row
8. Tap "Add Set" to add a new row, tap X to remove a row
9. Navigate between exercises using Previous/Next buttons
10. Tap "Finish Workout" -- verify summary dialog shows exercise count, set count, volume
11. Tap "Cancel Workout" -- verify confirmation dialog warns about data loss

**Visual Polish:**
12. Switch between all 4 tabs (Workouts, Templates, Analytics, Settings)
13. Verify: Smooth fade/shift transition between tabs
14. Verify: All screens use consistent dark theme (no bright/jarring inconsistencies)
15. Verify: Navigation bar uses consistent colors
16. Verify: Buttons, inputs, cards all look cohesive
17. Check templates list, exercise list, gym list for consistent styling
